      "summary": "Papa Bois is the ancient guardian spirit of forests and wildlife in Trinidad and Tobago folklore. Appearing as an elderly man with deer or goat hooves and covered in leaves and moss, he protects animals and punishes those who harm nature, while guiding respectful hunters and travelers.",
      "full": "Papa Bois, the 'Father of the Woods,' is one of Trinidad and Tobago's most revered forest spirits. He appears as an old man with a long white beard, dressed in bark and leaves, with the hooves of a deer or goat instead of feet. Sometimes he carries a twisted wooden staff and wears a wide-brimmed hat made of leaves. As the supreme protector of forests and all wild creatures, Papa Bois watches over the animals with paternal care, punishing poachers and those who overhunt or disrespect nature. However, he is benevolent to those who show proper respect for the forest, guiding lost travelers and teaching hunters traditional etiquette. His origins blend African forest deity traditions with European Green Man mythology and French Creole culture, making him a powerful symbol of environmental conservation and traditional ecological knowledge."
