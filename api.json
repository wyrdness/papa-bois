      "full": "Papa Bois, the \\\"Father of the Woods,\\\" is the ancient guardian spirit of forests and wildlife in Trinidad and Tobago folklore. He appears as an elderly man with a long white beard, dressed in bark and leaves, with the hooves of a deer or goat instead of feet. As the supreme protector of forests and all wild creatures, Papa Bois watches over the animals with paternal care, punishing poachers and those who overhunt or disrespect nature. However, Papa Bois is not cruel—he is benevolent to those who show proper respect for the forest. He guides lost travelers to safety, teaches hunters traditional etiquette, and maintains the delicate balance between human needs and nature's preservation. His presence represents the embodiment of traditional ecological knowledge and the spiritual dimension of environmental stewardship. Papa Bois emerges from a rich syncretism of West African forest deity traditions (particularly Yoruba Osanyin), European Green Man mythology, and French Creole culture. Today, he remains a vital symbol in Caribbean folklore and environmental education, teaching respect for nature through generations of stories and encounters."
